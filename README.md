# whatsapp-tracker

A simple online Tracker for the WhatsApp Web interface.

Hello there, this is my first python script, so bare with me if the code is a little bit messy. There are already some WhatsApp-Web python scripts out there but none of them worked fine for me so i made my own. 

Before you can run this script, you have to install python3 and the selenium bindings for python. To install the selenium package with pip:

````
pip install -U selenium
````

Then you have to download the specific driver to your Browser on their [Website](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/). I've used chrome but you can use any browser you like as long as you change it in the code itself.

When you have downloaded the driver just put it in the regarding folder of your operating system (in case of mac os i used /usr/local/bin/) and replace the driver location in the script.

That's it! Have fun using it
